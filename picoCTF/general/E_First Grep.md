# soal
Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

# hint
- grep [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php)

# solve
```
cat file | grep pico
# picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}
```

# flag
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}
