Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important. \
Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 59829 to get the flag? \
You'll also need the password f3b61b38. If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes. \
If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org \
If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell

# hint

- You can try logging in 'as' someone with <user>@titan.picoctf.net
- How could you specify the port?
- Remember, passwords are hidden when typed into the shell

ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 61952
