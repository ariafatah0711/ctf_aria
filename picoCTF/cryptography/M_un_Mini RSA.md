# soal
What happens if you have a small exponent? There is a twist though, we padded the plaintext so that (M ** e) is just barely larger than N. Let's decrypt this: ciphertext

# hint
- RSA [tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
- How could having too small of an e affect the security of this key?
- Make sure you don't lose precision, the numbers are pretty big (besides the e value)
- You shouldn't have to make too many guesses
- pico is in the flag, but not at the beginning
