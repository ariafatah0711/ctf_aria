The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. \
For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.

Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

# ssh
```bash
sshpass -p "FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
