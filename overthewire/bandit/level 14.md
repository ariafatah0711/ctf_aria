# soal
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. \
For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. \
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
